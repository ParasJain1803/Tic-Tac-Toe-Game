# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O", aiming to create a row, column, or diagonal of three matching symbols to win.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two-player turn-based system using "X" and "O".
- **Game Status Display**: Shows whose turn it is and announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Option to reset the game after each match, allowing players to start a new game without reloading the page.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and minimal design with CSS, focusing on gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the game structure, including the grid and status display.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the grid, buttons, and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including win conditions, player turns, and resetting the board.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParasJain1803/tic-tac-toe.git
2. Open the index.html file in any web browser.
3. Click on any square in the 3x3 grid to place your marker ("X" or "O"). The game will alternate between two players.
4. The first player to get three in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins! If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
